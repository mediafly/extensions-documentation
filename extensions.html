<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>Customers often wish to create rich, interactive content that include advanced UI effects, form entry, dynamic content, and more features that extend well beyond the limitations of PowerPoint or PDFs. With Mediafly Extensions and the Mediafly Platform, customers can create, release and control these packages.  This document serves as documentation for how a customer can create an Extension and what best practices exist in their creation and maintenance.</p>
<hr />
<h2>What are Extensions?</h2>
<p>Extensions are all the components that make up a static website:</p>
<ul>
<li>HTML files</li>
<li>JavaScript</li>
<li>CSS</li>
<li>Fonts</li>
<li>Images</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these files are packaged up in a specific way and uploaded to Mediafly Airship. These packages have the extension of <code>.mext</code>. Note: Packaging Extensions with the <code>.zip</code> is now obsolete and Viewer no longer supports this file extension for Extensions.</p>
<p>When the user opens the Extension, the app loads and renders the Extension much like it would a traditional web page.
<img alt="image" src="https://devdocs.mediafly.com/extensions/images/Extensions%20Overview.png" /></p>
<p>To ensure that the apps work consistently and correctly, the Extension developer needs to follow a few rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>The starting page must be named index.html .  This is the common starting point from which any package can launch.  Sub-pages are acceptable, as long as they are navigable from index.html.</li>
<li>
<p>Apps that reference third-party libraries (e.g. jQuery, jQuery Mobile, Reveal.js, Angular.JS) should relatively reference those files from the pages.  To be able to function while offline (for iOS and Android) no files should be absolutely referenced to a site on the web.  For example, an index.html file that contains the following is acceptable, because the files are relatively referenced:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;script src="js/jquery.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="css/main.css"&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>and an index.html file containing the following is not acceptable for offline use, because the files are absolutely referenced.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.8.2.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="http://mediafly.com/css/main.css"&gt;
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Communication between the App and Extension</h2>
<p>Extensions are single page applications. They allow for deep customization of the entire look and feel of the application. Because Extensions make use of the entire screen, Mediafly’s apps need to be told when to close the Extension as well as when to show other content.  The typical approach to this is:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Extension will provide a Menu or X button in the app.</li>
<li>When the user taps/clicks on the Menu button, notify the app to close the Extension</li>
<li>The app will close the Extension and navigate to other content where the user can resume their workflow.</li>
</ol>
<p>Extensions can link to other items within the hierarchy.  For example, if a user has access to one Extension and three other items (video, audio, documents, presentations, even other Extensions), the Extension can link directly to those items. </p>
<p>Extensions can invoke capabilities provided by the app such as Search and Collections as well.</p>
<hr />
<h1>Building Extensions</h1>
<h2>Developing and testing an Extension</h2>
<p>Mediafly provides a CLI (command line interface) utility called <code>extension-cli</code> to make it easier to test and develop an Extension. <code>extension-cli</code> allows an Extension developer to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Rapidly develop Extensions by live-reloading changes from the developer's machine.</li>
<li>Generate the <code>.mext</code> package from static files.</li>
<li>Upload the Extension into Airship.</li>
</ol>
<p>For more detailed instructions, refer to https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mediafly/extension-cli.</p>
<p>Note: You will need the <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">Node.js</a> runtime (v5 or higher) to use <code>extension-cli</code>. <code>extension-cli</code> is currently only supported on Viewer and iOS.</p>
<h2>Testing on device</h2>
<h3>weinre</h3>
<p>We strongly recommend the use of <a href="https://people.apache.org/~pmuellr/weinre/docs/latest/Home.html">weinre</a>, the WEb INspector REmote. It is a debugger for remote web pages, and in particular, it <i>allows you to debug web pages on mobile devices with your laptop</i>.</p>
<h4>How to use it</h4>
<p>Please read the <a href="https://people.apache.org/~pmuellr/weinre/docs/latest/Installing.html">installation</a> and <a href="http://people.apache.org/~pmuellr/weinre-docs/latest/Running.html">run</a> instructions on the website for details. But here is a simple overview:</p>
<ol>
<li>Install the tool via npm, (e.g. npm -g install weinre)</li>
<li>Run the debug server locally (e.g. weinre —boundHost 10.0.0.111)</li>
<li>Update the Extension with a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag to point to the debug server, and publish the new Extension in Airship (e.g. <code>&lt;script src="http://10.0.0.111:8080/target/target-script-min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code>). Open the Extension on your app</li>
<li>Point your PC/Mac browser to the debug client (e.g. http://10.0.0.111:8080)</li>
</ol>
<p>You now have access to a relatively full featured web development tool for your Extensions!</p>

<h1>API and Howtos</h1>
<p>This section describes all of the APIs available to Extensions developers. For each call, we list the mflyCommands.js call as well as the base URL. Please use the mflyCommands.js call where possible.</p>
<p><em>A note on 'Availability':</em> You will see many API calls have no version numbers within the Availability column. In these cases, the calls have been in existence for a sufficiently long period of time that Extensions developers no longer need to worry about whether their clients' apps support those calls anymore.</p>
<p><em>Keeping mflyCommands up-to-date:</em> mflyCommands.js is available on the <a href="http://bower.io/">bower package manager</a>. This is the recommended way of consuming it as a dependency in your Extension. The bower package can be found here: <a href="http://bower.io/search/?q=mfly-commands">http://bower.io/search/?q=mfly-commands</a></p>
<h2>Communicating with the app</h2>
<p>Communicating the app is done by calling functions on mflyCommands. The list of available functions, and their appropriate actions, are listed below.</p>
<p><strong><em>PLEASE NOTE</em></strong>: Every Extension must allow the user to close the item. Else, the user will be stuck within the Extension, with no way to exit.</p>
<h3>Getting baseline information</h3>
<p><em>mflyCommands.js:</em> mflyCommands.getInteractiveInfo() <br>
<em>Description:</em> Obtains baseline information about this Extension. Extensions can call this function and receive an object of initial configuration. Response example:</p>

<em>Availability:</em> Web Viewer, Win/Mac. Requires mflyCommands.js 1.13.0+.</p>
<h3>Links (Open and Goto)</h3>
<p>Two types of links exist within Extensions: Open and Goto. When an Extension "opens" an item, the item appears on top of the navigational stack, and the user is only given a single option to escape the item, by tapping Done/Close.  When an Extension "gotos" an item, the app opens that item and throws away the navigational stack behind it. The user is given the same navigational capabilities as if they opened the destination item directly.</p>
<p>To create either link, simply create a typical <code>&lt;a href&gt;</code> link with the source pointing to an mfly URL as specified below.</p>
<h4>Open an item</h4>
<p><em>mflyCommands.js:</em> mflyCommands.openItem(<em>id</em>) <br>
<em>Description:</em> Opens the specified item, where [id] is the ID of the item.  As described above, the historical navigational stack is maintained, and the user can return to it. The ID for an item can be found in Airship. Expand the item, and the ID is displayed at the bottom. <br>
<em>Availability:</em> iOS, Android, Web Viewer, Win/Mac</p>
<h4>Open an item from Search results, a Collection, or a Search Folder</h4>
<p>An Extension can render a Collection, Search Results, or a Search Folder in its UI and leverage the app to open items from them. If the context is supplied, the app will allow the user to present all items from the given context from the playlist that is shown when the item is opened.</p>
<p>Examples:
Open an item from a collection:</p>
<p><em>mflyCommands.js:</em> mflyCommands.openItem(<em>id</em>, { context: 'collection', collection: <em>collectionId</em> }) <br></p>
<p>Open an item from search results:</p>
<p><em>mflyCommands.js:</em> mflyCommands.openItem(<em>id</em>, { context: 'search', search: <em>searchTerm</em> }) <br></p>
<p>Open an item from a search folder:</p>
<p><em>mflyCommands.js:</em> mflyCommands.openItem(<em>id</em>, { context: 'searchFolder', parentSlug: <em>searchFolderId</em> }) <br></p>
<p><em>Availability:</em> iOS, Android, Web Viewer, Win/Mac</p>
<h4>Open a folder</h4>
<p><em>mflyCommands.js:</em> mflyCommands.openFolder(<em>id</em>) <br>
<em>Description:</em> Opens the specified folder, where [id] is the ID of the folder.  As described above, the historical navigational stack is maintained, and the user can return to it. The ID for a folder can be found in Airship. Expand the item, and the ID is displayed at the bottom. <br>
<em>Availability:</em> iOS, Android, Web Viewer, Win/Mac</p>
<h4>Goto an item or a folder (<em>deprecated</em>)</h4>
<p><em>mflyCommands.js:</em> mflyCommands.goto(<em>id</em>) <br>
<em>Description:</em> Gotos the specified item or folder, where [id] is the ID of the item or folder.  As described above, when the app goes to another item or folder, the navigational stack behind the destination is thrown away, and the user is given the same navigational capabilities as if they opened the destination item directly. The ID for a folder can be found in Airship. Expand the item, and the ID is displayed at the bottom. <br>
<em>Availability:</em> iOS, Android</p>
<h3>Filter (<em>deprecated</em>)</h3>
<p>Filter is deprecated in favor of mflyCommands.search() using the advanced query syntax.</p>
<p>Using mflyCommands.search() with metadata fields:</p>
<pre><code>mflyCommands.search('fieldName EQUALS "Field Value"')
</code></pre>
<p>We often find that developers need to identify folders and items that match a specific set of metadata. Often they want to use custom metadata fields as a way to drive hierarchy and categorization, and not rely on the actual hierarchy for that purpose. It makes sense in some use cases, because the people who will be managing content are often different from how the Extension should be rendered.</p>
<p>To support this, use Filter. Filter accepts up to three key=value pairs as JSON parameters, and returns a constrained list of folders and items that match ALL of the key=value pairs provided. The return value is a JSON Array of JSON Objects that match the various folders and items with the specified filter conditions, or an empty JSON Array if none match.</p>
<p><em>mflyCommands.js:</em> mflyCommands.filter(<em>obj</em>) <br>
Examples:</p>
<pre><code>Example 1:

    mflyCommands.filter({ "shouldShow": false }).done(function(results) {
        // results contains, e.g.
        // [ { "id": "123", "shouldShow": true, ... },
        //   { "id": "234", "shouldShow": false, ... } ]
    });

Example 2:

    mflyCommands.filter({ "shouldShow": false, "key": "doesNotExist" }).done(function(results) {
        // results contains, e.g.
        // []
    });
</code></pre>
<p><em>Availability:</em> iOS, Android, Web Viewer, Win/Mac</p>
<h3>Search</h3>
<p>Mediafly's apps provide real-time, native search as a core part of the functionality. There are two ways to work with Search:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use the native app's core Search UI. In this case, you simply need to open the Search dialog and let the user use that dialog. See "Show Search dialog" below.</li>
<li>Implement your own UI. In this case, you use the mflyCommands.search() call to get search results given terms, and then render the UI as you wish. See "Search by keyword" below.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Advanced Search</h4>
<p>Advanced search syntax can help Extensions find folders and content more efficiently using mflyCommands.search(). You can find the advanced search syntax documentation at: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bQYRjKo_ctmv1OQQKo5qQKzRLaXnWgGBebdCdbs3-Mw/edit#heading=h.h6m5kboybjil">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bQYRjKo_ctmv1OQQKo5qQKzRLaXnWgGBebdCdbs3-Mw/edit#heading=h.h6m5kboybjil</a> </p>
<h4>Show Search dialog (<em>deprecated</em>)</h4>
<p><em>mflyCommands.js:</em> mflyCommands.showSearch(<em>x-coord, y-coord, width, height</em>) <br>
<em>Description:</em> Shows the search dialog at x-coord, y-coord coordinates with the specified width and height. Parameters x-coord, y-coord, width, and height are all optional, and only work with iOS. <br>
<em>Availability:</em> iOS</p>
<h4>Search by keyword</h4>
<p><em>mflyCommands.js:</em> mflyCommands.search(<em>term</em>, <em>offset</em>, <em>limit</em>) <br>
<em>Description:</em> Conduct a search for the given keyword. Return value is a JSON-array of folders and items. Parameters offset and limit are optional.<br>
<em>Availability:</em> iOS, Android, Web Viewer, Win/Mac</p>
<h3>Get Recently Created Content</h3>
<p>You can use this call to get a list of content that was recently created for the user.</p>
<p><em>mflyCommands.js:</em> mflyCommands.getRecentlyCreatedContent() <br>
<em>Description:</em> Returns a JSON respresentation of the recently created content. <br>
<em>Availability:</em> iOS, Android, Web Viewer, Win/Mac <br>

<hr />
<h2>Saving and retrieving key/value data</h2>
<p>Extensions can save data to and retrieve data from the app with AJAX. This is useful for persisting data within or between Extensions. After saving, you can be sure that your data will be saved if the user restarts the app or device. You can use any key you wish, which provides a lot of flexibility, but please consider providing a namespace within your keys. Otherwise, two Extensions may find ways to clobber each others’ keys.</p>
<p>On iOS, Android, Windows and Mac, key/value data is isolated by user and by app. So, two users cannot share keys, and two apps cannot share keys.</p>
<p>For web Extensions, key/value data is stored in local storage. There is no isolation provided between key/value data between users or environments. We advise you to prefix your keys if there is a chance that the key will be accessed from multiple environments or users.</p>
<p>There are two approaches to reading and writing data:</p>
<ul>
<li>Synced: this method stores data locally and also synchronizes the data to Mediafly's servers. If a user saves key=value on Device A, then loads the Extension on Device B, Device B will pull down key=value onto Device B as the Extension loads.</li>
<li>Local: this method stores data locally and does not synchronize with our servers. If a user uninstalls the app (iOS, Android, Windows, Mac) clears their cookies (web), or uses a private/incognito window (web) the keys will be erased and cannot be retrieved.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these approaches has different mflyCommands calls, as detailed below. Generally, most developers will want to use the Synced approach.</p>
<h3>Save data (synced)</h3>
<p>To save data to the app container, call mflyCommands.putSyncedValue(<em>key, value</em>), where <em>key</em> is the key you wish to save, and <em>value</em> is the value for that key.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em><br>
This example saves key/value data, using mflyCommands.js.</p>
<pre><code>var key = $('#key').val();
var value = { name: ‘abc’, value: ‘def’ };

mflyCommands.putSyncedValue(key, value)
    .done(function(data, status) {
        // Success! Do something.
    })
    .fail(function(deferred, status) {
        // Error! Do something.
    });
</code></pre>
<p>HTTP response codes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Response of 200 OK indicates a successful save to an existing key</li>
<li>Response of 201 Created indicates a successful save to a new key</li>
<li>Response of 400 Bad Request is returned if the value has not been previously saved</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Availability:</em> iOS, Android, Web Viewer, Win/Mac</p>
<h3>Retrieve data (synced)</h3>
<p>You can retrieve value information from keys in multiple ways using mflyCommands.js.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can make the calls directly with AJAX, but we strongly recommend using mflyCommands instead. When making calls directly,</p>
<ul>
<li>Response of 200 OK indicates a successful get of an existing key. The body of the response will contain the values indicated below.</li>
<li>Response of 404 Not Found indicates that the key does not exist</li>
</ul>
<h4>Single key</h4>
<p>To get data for a specific key from the app container, use mflyCommands.getSyncedValue(<em>key</em>).</p>
<p><em>Example:</em></p>
<pre><code>// Assume key 'abc' has been set to value '123'.

mflyCommands.getSyncedValue('abc')
    .done(function(data, status) {
        // Success! Do something.
        console.log(data);
    })
    .fail(function(deferred, status) {
        // Error! Do something.
    });

// Console output: 123
</code></pre>
<p>On successful retrieval, data will contain the value of the key.</p>
<h4>All keys</h4>
<p>To get data for all keys from the app container, use mflyCommands.getSyncedValues().</p>
<p><em>Example:</em></p>
<pre><code>// Assume key 'abc' has been set to value '123', and key 'def' has been set to value '456'.

mflyCommands.getSyncedValues()
    .done(function(data, status) {
        // Success! Do something.
        console.log(data);
    })
    .fail(function(deferred, status) {
        // Error! Do something.
    });

// Console output: { "abc": "123", "def": "456" }
</code></pre>
<p>On successful retrieval, body will contain a JSON object enumerating all keys and values, as shown above.</p>
<h4>Key prefix</h4>
<p>To get data for all keys that begin with X, use mflyCommands.getSyncedValues(<em>prefix</em>). On successful retrieval, data will contain a JSON object enumerating all keys and values where the keys begin with X.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em></p>
<pre><code>// Assume:
//   key 'snow' has been set to value 'white',
//   key 'snowball' has been set to value 'round',
//   key 'fire' has been set to value 'red'

mflyCommands.getSyncedValues('snow')
    .done(function(data, status) {
        // Success! Do something.
        console.log(data);
    })
    .fail(function(deferred, status) {
        // Error! Do something.
    });

// Console output: { "snow": "white", "snowball": "round" }

mflyCommands.getSyncedValues('abc')
    .done(function(data, status) {
        // Success! Do something.
        console.log(data);
    })
    .fail(function(deferred, status) {
        // Error! Do something.
    });

// Console output: {}
</code></pre>
<p><em>Availability:</em> iOS, Android, Web Viewer, Win/Mac</p>
<h3>Delete data (synced)</h3>
<p>To delete a key/value pair by key from the app container, use mflyCommands.deleteSyncedKey(<em>key</em>).</p>
<p><em>Example:</em></p>
<pre><code>// Assume key 'abc' has been set to value '123'.

mflyCommands.deleteSyncedKey('abc')
    .done(function(data, status) {
        // Success! Do something.
        console.log('abc has been deleted');
    })
    .fail(function(deferred, status) {
        // Error! Do something.
    });

// Console output: 'abc has been deleted'
</code></pre>
<p><em>Availability:</em> iOS, Android, Web Viewer, Win/Mac</p>
<h3>Save data (local)</h3>
<p>To save data to the app container, call mflyCommands.putValue(<em>key, value</em>), where <em>key</em> is the key you wish to save, and <em>value</em> is the value for that key.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em><br>
This example saves key/value data, using mflyCommands.js.</p>
<pre><code>var key = $('#key').val();
var value = { name: ‘abc’, value: ‘def’ };

mflyCommands.putValue(key, value)
    .done(function(data, status) {
        // Success! Do something.
    })
    .fail(function(deferred, status) {
        // Error! Do something.
    });
</code></pre>
<p>HTTP response codes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Response of 200 OK indicates a successful save to an existing key</li>
<li>Response of 201 Created indicates a successful save to a new key</li>
<li>Response of 400 Bad Request is returned if the value has not been previously saved</li>
</ul>
<p>(Note: attempts were made to use HTTP PUT verbs, but iOS seems to strip out the body of the PUT, so we migrated to use GET instead).</p>
<p><em>Example:</em><br>
This example saves key/value data, using jQuery.</p>
<pre><code>var key = $('#key').val();
var value = { name: ‘abc’, value: ‘def’ };

$.ajax({

<h3>Retrieve data (local)</h3>
<p>You can retrieve value information from keys in multiple ways using mflyCommands.js.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can make the calls directly with AJAX, but we strongly recommend using mflyCommands instead. When making calls directly,</p>
<ul>
<li>Response of 200 OK indicates a successful get of an existing key. The body of the response will contain the values indicated below.</li>
<li>Response of 404 Not Found indicates that the key does not exist</li>
</ul>
<h4>Single key</h4>
<p>To get data for a specific key from the app container, use mflyCommands.getValue(<em>key</em>).</p>
<p><em>Example:</em></p>
<pre><code>// Assume key 'abc' has been set to value '123'.

mflyCommands.getValue('abc')
    .done(function(data, status) {
        // Success! Do something.
        console.log(data);
    })
    .fail(function(deferred, status) {
        // Error! Do something.
    });

// Console output: 123
</code></pre>
<p>On successful retrieval, data will contain the value of the key.</p>
<h4>All keys</h4>
<p>To get data for all keys from the app container, use mflyCommands.getValues().</p>
<p><em>Example:</em></p>
<pre><code>// Assume key 'abc' has been set to value '123', and key 'def' has been set to value '456'.

mflyCommands.getValues()
    .done(function(data, status) {
        // Success! Do something.
        console.log(data);
    })
    .fail(function(deferred, status) {
        // Error! Do something.
    });

// Console output: { "abc": "123", "def": "456" }
</code></pre>
<p>On successful retrieval, body will contain a JSON object enumerating all keys and values, as shown above.</p>
<h4>Key prefix</h4>
<p>To get data for all keys that begin with X, use mflyCommands.getValues(<em>prefix</em>). On successful retrieval, data will contain a JSON object enumerating all keys and values where the keys begin with X.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em></p>
<pre><code>// Assume:
//   key 'snow' has been set to value 'white',
//   key 'snowball' has been set to value 'round',
//   key 'fire' has been set to value 'red'

mflyCommands.getValues('snow')
    .done(function(data, status) {
        // Success! Do something.
        console.log(data);
    })
    .fail(function(deferred, status) {
        // Error! Do something.
    });

// Console output: { "snow": "white", "snowball": "round" }

mflyCommands.getValues('abc')
    .done(function(data, status) {
        // Success! Do something.
        console.log(data);
    })
    .fail(function(deferred, status) {
        // Error! Do something.
    });

// Console output: {}
</code></pre>
<p><em>Availability:</em> iOS, Android, Web Viewer, Win/Mac</p>
<h3>Delete data (local)</h3>
<p>To delete a key/value pair by key from the app container, use mflyCommands.deleteKey(<em>key</em>).</p>
<p><em>Example:</em></p>
<pre><code>// Assume key 'abc' has been set to value '123'.

mflyCommands.deleteKey('abc')
    .done(function(data, status) {
        // Success! Do something.
        console.log('abc has been deleted');
    })
    .fail(function(deferred, status) {
        // Error! Do something.
    });

// Console output: 'abc has been deleted'

<h2>Emailing content from Extensions</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Extensions can have Mediafly's backend send emails with attachments. Attachments are Base64 encoded URLs.
Even though emails are sent from Mediafly's servers, they have "Reply-To" field populated with the curent logged in user's email address.</p>
<p><em>Example</em></p>
<pre><code>mflyCommands.sendEmail({
    to: '[to email address]',
    subject: '[email subject]',
    body: '[email body]',
    attachments: [{
        filename: "[name of the attachment. for example: Presentation.pdf]",
        dataUrl: "[Base64 encoded URL]"
    }]
}).done(function(data, status) {
    // Success! Do something.
    console.log('email has been sent successfully');
})
.fail(function(deferred, status) {
    // Error! Do something.
    console.log('error sending email');
});

<h2>Embedding images, other Extensions, or pages of documents</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Extensions have the ability to embed items that exist in the app into it.  This is used for four primary purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Retrieve an item that contains structured data (JSON, XML, CSV)</li>
<li>Embed an item that is an image and render it as an image in this Extension</li>
<li>Embed another Extension into an iframe on this Extension</li>
<li>Embed a page from a PowerPoint, PDF, or Word document</li>
</ul>
<p>Embedding other types (audio, video, URLs) will have unexpected results. The best user experience will be provided to the user only if embedding is limited to data, images, documents and Extensions.</p>
<ul>
<li>To retrieve a data item, use <code>mflyCommands.getData(id)</code>, where <em>id</em> is the ID of the data item you wish to obtain.</li>
<li>To embed an image, create an <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> that refers to a loading image. In JavaScript, call <code>mflyCommands.embed($element, id)</code>, where <em>$element</em> is a jQuery reference to the img element, and <em>id</em> is the Airship id of the image item.<ul>
<li>You can also use <code>mflyCommands.embedImage($element, id, options)</code> and supply dimensions for the image to be embedded (only supported on Web Viewer and requires mflyCommands.js version 1.4.10). This can be particularly helpful to scale down high resolution images to so browsers can load them quicker. <em>options</em> are defined as:<ul>
<li><em>size</em> (string):   format is WxH (e.g. "200x200")</li>
<li><em>width</em> (number): Width of the image</li>
<li><em>height</em> (number): Height of the image</li>
<li><em>maxWidth</em> (number): Maximum width of the image</li>
<li><em>maxHeight</em> (number): Maximum height of the image</li>
<li><em>rotate</em> (number): Degree of rotation to apply to the image. Values of 0, 90, 180, 270, or 360 are acceptable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To embed another Extension, construct an <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>. In JavaScript, call <code>mflyCommands.embed($element, id)</code>, where <em>$element</em> is a jQuery reference to the iframe element, and <em>id</em> is the Airship id of the other Extension.</li>
<li>To embed the page from a document as an image, create an <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> that refers to a loading image. In JavaScript, call <code>mflyCommands.embed($element, id, page)</code>, where <em>$element</em> is a jQuery reference to the img element, <em>id</em> is the Airship id of the image item, and <em>page</em> is the page number that you wish to embed.</li>
<li>Please note: if you are embedding an image asset for the web Viewer, please consider directly accessing the <code>resourceUrl</code> attribute instead of using <code>mflyCommands.embed</code>. This will improve loading speed, caching, and reduce network requests. See the <a href="#optional_changes">optional changes</a> section below.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>See our <a href="https://github.com/mediafly/extensions-examples/tree/master/examples/Embed%20and%20Data%20Items">open-source 'Embed and Data Items' Extension</a> for an excellent working example of all four types of Embed described above.</p>
<h3>Technical details</h3>
<p>Here are the HTTP response codes by platform. Unfortunately, these are not all the same because of differing security limitations across platforms.</p>
<p>State | iOS | Android
------------ | ------------- | ------------
Item downloaded and ready | HTTP response code 301 (Redirect). Browser should automatically redirect to correct URL. Body contains retrieved data.  | HTTP response code 200. Body contains retrieved data.
Item not already downloaded | HTTP response code 202 (Accepted), with Retry-After header set to number of seconds the Extension should wait before trying again. If not set, default to a reasonable value, like 5. | HTTP response code 200, with an empty body. Extension should retry after a reasonable number of seconds, like 5.
Item not found | HTTP response code 404 (Not found) | HTTP response code 404 (Not found)</p>
<p>Please note that asking too many times may put the Downloader into a race condition, as each request will trigger the Downloader to poll and possibly start downloading again.  So, please be considerate and retry no more than once every few seconds.</p>
<p>As you can see, embedding requires care. You cannot assume that the embedded item is available yet, because it may be behind some longer items in the Downloader. Instead, you have to try to fetch the content and monitor response codes. This is why we suggest using mflyCommands.js as shown in the example above.</p>
<p><em>Availability:</em> iOS, Android, Web Viewer, Win/Mac</p>
<h3>Reporting when embedding pages</h3>
<p>Our Reporting system automatically captures who viewed what, when, and where, when using the native app that sits underneath the Extension. However, when you embed pages, the app loses that information and is unable to tell our systems about view data.</p>
<p>To inform our Reporting system of a page view, post a page view after the page has been shown to the user:</p>
<p><em>mflyCommands.js:</em> mflyCommands.postPageView(<em>item ID</em>, <em>page number</em>) <br>
<em>Description:</em> Posts the page view to the Mediafly Reporting system. Item ID is the id of the item, as seen in Airship. Page number is the page that was displayed (starting at page 1).
<em>Availability:</em> iOS</p>
<h3>Reporting</h3>
<p>When building an Extension that implements its own navigation instead of relying on the, the Extension is responsible for notifying Mediafly's Reporting system.</p>
<p>To inform our Reporting system of various actions:</p>
<p><em>mflyCommands.js:</em> mflyCommands.postAction(options) <br>
<em>Description:</em> Posts the action to the Mediafly Reporting system. Options object supplied contains:
  - type (required): Type can one of the following: "collection", "document", "navigation" or "search"
  - id (required when type is not "search"): Item ID is the id of the item, as seen in Airship
  - term (required when type is "search"): search term used to perform a search</p>
<p><em>Availability:</em> iOS, Android, Web Viewer, Win/Mac</p>

<h2>Support widescreen on iOS</h2>
<h3>Control</h3>
<p>When a user plugs into an HDMI dongle or connects via AirPlay, they can change the app to run in Second Screen mode.  When in this mode, the app can paint a canvas that uses the entire screen resolution (whereas, Mirroring mode restricts the TV/projector to a 4x3 output and adds black bars on the left and right).</p>
<p>TODO: Add screenshots of what this looks like</p>
<p>To support this mode in an Extension, the Extension must do a few things.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>On the app call to mflyDataInit, the object returned must have mflyWideScreenSupport set:</p>
<pre><code>{
  “mflyWideScreenSupport”: true
  ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>Other parameters may exist in this JSON object, of course, but mflyWideScreenSupport is the key to initiate proper app support for widescreen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the app has sent mflyWideScreenSupport=true in mflyDataInit, the Extension should expect to receive a call from the app to mflyWideScreen(useWideScreen), where useWidescreen is either true or false.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Example:</em><br></p>
<pre><code>    &lt;script&gt;
        function mflyWideScreen(useWideScreen) {
            if (useWideScreen) {
                // Refresh the UI to show in 16x9 mode,
                // probably by adjusting CSS. On the iPad, black bars will
                // appear above and below the content.
            } else {
                // Refresh the UI to show in 4x3 mode on iPad only
            }
        }
    &lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
<ol>
<li>
<p>(Optional) Create a button that the user taps to bring up the Second Screen Options dialog. This button in the Extension would mimic the button in the native app that allows the user to switch between iOS, Mirroring, and Second Screen. When tapped, the Extension should invoke:</p>
<pre><code>mflyCommands.showSecondScreenOptions();
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>(Optional) The app can be notified when the user flips second-screen mode on or off. When the user changes to/from second-screen mode, the app will call mflySecondScreenAvailable(bool), where bool is true or false. Apps can react to this call to render a button to invoke the Second Screen Options dialog.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Example:</em><br></p>
<pre><code>    function mflySecondScreenAvailable(isAvailable) {
        if (isAvailable) {
            // Second screen is now on/available.
            $("#secondScreenOptionsBtn").show();
        } else {
            // Second screen is no longer available.
            $("#secondScreenOptionsBtn").hide();
        }
    }
</code></pre>
<h3>UIWebKit Resolution</h3>
<p>When the iPad is displaying an Extension only on its canvas, the WebKit container is 1024 x 568.  When the iPad is projecting to Second Screen, the WebKit container shrinks to 960 x 540. This allows for the browser to efficiently scale up when connected to 720p and 1080p TVs.</p>
<p>To account for this, we suggest tagging the <body> element with a class that denotes either "ipad" or "widescreen", and adjusting your layout and images based on this.  </p>
<p><em>Example:</em><br></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You may tag specific images or image types based on whether they are in second screen or not:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;style&gt;
.ipad .carousel_image       { width: 1024px; height: 378px;
    background:url('image.png'); background-size: 1024px 378px; }
.widescreen .carousel_image { width: 960px; height: 354px;
    background:url(''image.png'); background-size: 960px 354px; }
&lt;/style&gt;
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>The body tag is initially decorated to be iPad-focused:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;body class="ipad"&gt;
...
&lt;/body&gt;
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the user switches between Second Screen and Disabled, the <body> tag changes its class:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;script&gt;
function mflyWideScreen(isWidescreen) {
    if (isWidescreen) {
        $("body").removeClass("ipad").addClass("widescreen");
    } else {
        $("body").removeClass("widescreen").addClass("ipad");
    }
}
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Note</em>: You will likely have to fix the container to 960x540 when in Widescreen. We have seen cases where, if the container is left to auto width/height, and the user invokes the keyboard on the iPad (say, a search field), a giant black space where that keyboard was appears on the second screen. We have seen this on iOS 7.0.x; it may have been corrected in iOS 7.1+ and may no longer be relevant.</p>

<h2>Getting temporary credentials to communicate with Launchpad and Accounts APIs</h2>
<p>Launchpad API allows abilities such as uploading files, and updating items in Airship. If an Extensions wishes to leverage these capabilities, it need to be authenticated. Extensions can call <code>mflyCommands.getCredentials()</code> function to retrive the necessary credentials to access these APIs. The response from <code>getCredentials</code> contains a short lived access token. It is the Extension's responsibility to get a new token when the existing token expires (If an API endpoint returns a <code>401</code> HTTP response code, a new token should be retrieved). In addition to the token, <code>environmentId</code> is also returned which is necessary to make calls to the Launchpad API.</p>
<p><em>Example</em></p>
<pre><code>mflyCommands.getCredentials();

Result:
{
    "accessToken": "token",
    "environmentId": "environmentId",
}
</code></pre>

<h2>Other useful information</h2>
<h3>Stopping rubber band effects</h3>
<p>Since Extensions are embedded web pages, on some (particularly iOS) devices they tend to have a “rubber band” effect.  E.g. if touch-and-hold a part of the Extension, then drag it, the entire screen will follow your finger, then "snap back" after you let go.  This does not feel appropriate for an Extension, as users want the look and feel to be more native.</p>
<p>To address this, we recommend using <a href="http://eightmedia.github.io/hammer.js/">Hammer.js</a>, a mobile-focused touch gesture library.</p>
<p>We have created a detailed example within Mediafly Extensions Examples that demonstrates this, <a href="https://github.com/mediafly/extensions-examples/tree/master/examples/Swipe">here</a>.</p>
<h3>Smoother scrolling</h3>
<p>By default, iOS scrolling in the UIWebView is exactly controlled by your finger. You can drag the web view down and up, but you cannot "throw" the page in a direction. Furthermore, if you have a lot of large images on the page, scrolling can become choppy.</p>
<p>To alleviate this, consider implementing <code>-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch</code> on your DOM nodes that handle scrolling. When set to touch, UIWebView uses native-style scrolling on your node.</p>
<h3>Invoking an Extension with parameters (iOS)</h3>
<p>iOS support invocation URLS. An item can be linked to using these URLs.</p>
<p>Example: <a href="onmediafly://9cf282320e6340ee8b830e5376d54531product265958?param1=1&amp;param2=">onmediafly://9cf282320e6340ee8b830e5376d54531product265958?param1=1&amp;param2=2</a></p>
<p>This URL has the following format: [mcode]://[id]?[params...]</p>
<p>The iOS app will pass all supplied params to the Extension and the Extension can
retrieve them using JavaScript <code>window.location.search</code>.</p>
<hr />
<h1>Appendix</h1>
<p>Additional information that doesn't fit very well elsewhere.</p>
<h2>Supporting Extensions for the Web, Windows and Mac</h2>
<p>With Web Extensions, developers can now also support all major browsers and all major mobile platforms easily and cleanly.</p>
<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<p>Web Extensions will be able to make use of the same delivery mechanism and API as Extensions available on iOS and Android today. When the user opens an Extension in the Web Viewer, the web server will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unzip the Extension zip file</li>
<li>Point to index.html</li>
<li>Proxy requests to the Extensions API to the correct URL</li>
</ul>
<p>Provided that you are using mflyCommands.js, the API will remain largely unchanged. Only a few minor issues need to be addressed for you to take full advantage of Extensions on the Web.</p>
<h3>Required changes</h3>
<p>The following changes need to be made to your existing Extensions to support Extensions on the Web:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Use mflyCommands.js, and keep it up to date</strong>. This should be your primary way to access our API. Don't make mfly:// calls to the API directly, as those simply will not work in web browsers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Don't assume a specific browser or size</strong>. The luxurious days of assuming latest Safari (iOS) or Google Chrome (Android 4.4+) are over. Build your Extension like you would a standard website, because, it can be opened on any browser like a standard website.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Don't rely on mflyDataInit, rely on mflyCommands.getInteractiveInfo() </strong>. Web Extensions will not call "into" the Extension. This means that mflyDataInit, mflySync, mflyResume, mflyPause, and mflyInit are not supported. Instead, make a new call once the document has been initialized: <code>mflyCommands.getInteractiveInfo()</code>. This asynchronous function will obtain the same information that mflyDataInit used to be called with, like so:</p>
<pre><code>mflyCommands.getInteractiveInfo()
    .done(function(data) {
        // data contains a JSON object with information
        // about this app, user and Extension
    }).fail(function() {
        // handle failure
    });
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em> Don't include a file at the root of your Extension called mflyManifest.json</em></strong>. We doubt you would, but if you do, it is likely to be overwritten by one of your apps as a part of the initialization process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Adjust mflyCommands.getFolder(id) call signature change</strong>. The call signature for mflyCommands.getFolder(id) has changed. Previously, if any of its items were also folders, it would return the items within the folders as an array of IDs. This has changed, and those subfolders no longer includes the items key at all. A separate mflyCommands.getFolder(id) call will have to be made on those children folders.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Each URL should be able to establish its own state</strong>. Don't pass around variables like you would in a traditional application. This breaks on websites, and it will break on web Extensions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>All resources must be accessed in a relative way</strong>. Don't try to construct absolute URLs to assets within your .zip file, as that path will undoutedly differ on other platforms.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Optional changes</h3>
<p>The following changes will help improve performance for your Extensions when opened in the Web Viewer.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>To render images, consider using the <code>resourceUrl</code> attribute and not mflyCommands.embed</strong>. The resourceUrl attribute can be found on mflyCommands.[getFolder, getItem, filter], and other calls that return full item models. The benefits are many:</p>
<ul>
<li>resourceUrl requests are more easily cached by browsers</li>
<li>resourceUrl requests return the original image in its original format (jpg, png, gif), with no transcoding</li>
<li>resourceUrl requests require one less redirect, which means faster load times</li>
</ul>
<p>There are downsides to using resourceUrl as well, however.</p>
<ul>
<li>Because resourceUrl (currently) only exists on the web Viewer, you will need to separate your approach of laying in images between our web Viewer and our mobile platforms.</li>
<li>If you need to ask Mediafly's servers to resize images, you will need to use mflyCommands.embed to do so, as resourceUrl returns the image as-is.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Constants</h2>
<p>The following constants can be used across customer environments or within an environment:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>__root__</code>: This is the ID of the top-level folder. It is consistent across all environments and all device platforms.</li>
<li><code>[environment ID]productmyitems</code>: This is the ID of the "My Items" folder. "My Items" is a folder that, when enabled, gives users a personal space to upload and manage their own content within the customer environment. In this case, <code>[environment ID]</code> is a unique 32-character string that is specific to that environment. Please contact Mediafly to obtain the string for your customers; or, simply use Get Folder on the <code>__root__</code> and look for My Items as the last folder in the response. In order to access My Items, the user must be logged in.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Deprecated</h2>
<p>These are calls that you may encounter, but have been deprecated. They remain here historical purposes. They will be deleted from our apps and this documentation in the near future.</p>
<h3>mflyDataInit (<em>deprecated</em>)</h3>
<p><b>PLEASE NOTE:</b> Use mflyCommands.getInteractiveInfo where possible.</p>
<p>This function has two uses:</p>
<ol>
<li>Receive configuration information from the app, and</li>
<li>Send configuration parameters to the app</li>
</ol>
<h4>Use 1: Receive configuration information from the app</h4>
<p>Extensions can implement mflyDataInit, using method 1.</p>
<pre><code>    function mflyDataInit(obj) {
        // obj = JSON object that contains initial configuration
    }
</code></pre>
<p>mflyDataInit will be called with a JSON object that contains initial configuration.  E.g. on iOS, params may be a JSON Object such as this:</p>
<pre><code>    {
        "mflyInitVersionMaximum": "2",
        "user": "jshah@mediafly.com",
        "displayName": "Jason Shah",
        "item": "Custom Dynamic Extension 1.2",
        “id”: “29342938241238product234234”,
        "osType": "iOS",
        "osVersion": "6.1.2",
        "appVersion": "6.1.4.405",
        "deviceId": "4639ufu115f0630a13a8744e8b5cc6309b46",
        "lastUpdated": "2014-02-03T07:04:07-06:00"
    }
</code></pre>
<p><em>Supported parameters:</em><br></p>
<ul>
<li>mflyInitVersionMaximum: indicates how many possible values mflyInitVersion can have in the return value (see below).</li>
<li>user: user_context (essentially, system-known username)</li>
<li>displayName: display name. Can be email, first+last, or something similar</li>
<li>item: title of this Extension</li>
<li>id: the slug (unique id) of this Extension within Airship</li>
<li>osType: which OS (iOS, Android, Windows, Mac)</li>
<li>osVersion: which version of the OS</li>
<li>appVersion: which version of the app</li>
<li>deviceId: the unique device ID for this device</li>
<li>lastUpdated: the lasted updated time. This is good for debugging purposes, to help you identify which version of the Extension you are looking at on the device</li>
</ul>
<h4>Use 2: Send configuration parameters to the app</h4>
<p>Optionally, Extensions can then return a JSON Object with specifics on how the app should behave.  E.g. on iOS, return value may be a JSON Object such as this:</p>
<pre><code>    {
      “mflyInitVersion”: “4”,
      “mflyWideScreenSupport”: true
    }
</code></pre>
<p><em>Supported parameters:</em><br></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>mflyInitVersion: indicates which version of mflyInit should be called by the app. Android supports versions 3, 4, and 5 of mflyInitVersion. If ignored, defaults to "4".</p>
<ul>
<li>"2": default version reflected in this documentation. Supported on iOS.</li>
<li>"3": On iOS, sharing status is represented by canShare, canAccessAssetOffline, and canDownloadAsset. Supported on Android, iOS, and Windows8.</li>
<li>"4": No longer sends down mflyInit. mflyInit is deprecated and causes undo burden when content libraries are large, and we plan to deprecate it in the future. Supported on Android and iOS.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>mflyWideScreenSupport: if true, this makes the app aware that the Extension can handle widescreen second screens (HDMI, Apple TV).  This is specifically for the case where the Extension has been designed to be a presentation-worthy UI for second screens. Only available on iOS.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Example:</em><br></p>
<pre><code>function mflyDataInit(obj) {
    // Do initialization
    return '{ "mflyInitVersion" : "4" }';
}
</code></pre>
<p><em>Availability:</em> iOS and Android. Not all parameters will be available on Android.</p>
<h3>mflyResume (<em>deprecated</em>)</h3>
<p>The app calls this function when the app opens and shows the Extension.  If you need to start animation or take other action when the Extension shows, this is the place to do it.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em><br></p>
<pre><code>function mflyResume() {
    // Handle mflyResume
}
</code></pre>
<p><em>Availability:</em> iOS, Android</p>
<h3>mflyPause (<em>deprecated</em>)</h3>
<p>The app calls this function when the user hides the Extension. If you need to stop animation, submit a form, or take other action when the Extension hides, this is the place to do it.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em><br></p>
<pre><code>function mflyPause() {
    // Handle mflyPause
}
</code></pre>
<p><em>Availability:</em> iOS, Android</p>
<h3>Sync Status (<em>deprecated</em>)</h3>
<p>Our apps are built to automatically sync all folders on launch and at regular intervals. Sometimes, the Extension needs to know about the status of sync to ensure that sufficient content is loaded before rendering the Extension. To receive information about the status of sync, apps can listen to events injected into the DOM's document object, and react to those events.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em><br></p>
<pre><code>document.addEventListener("mflySyncStatus", function(d) {
    if (d &amp;&amp; d.detail) {
        // Handle Sync Status
        $("#syncEventHandlerResult").html(JSON.stringify(d.detail, null, 2));
    }
}, false);
</code></pre>
<p>The detail attribute of the event object will be structure as JSON with 2-3 fields, like so:</p>
<pre><code>{
    complete: 26,
    total: 28,
    isrunning: true
}
</code></pre>
<p>where the JSON object's attributes have the following meaning:</p>
<ul>
<li>complete: the number of folders that have been synced</li>
<li>total: the total number of folders known to the app. Note that this may not be defined immediately on application start, and may change if there are dramatic changes of what is available to the user.</li>
<li>isrunning: true|false, indicating whether the sync is currently running.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Availability:</em> iOS (604), Android (2.23.59)</p>
<h3>mflyInit (<em>deprecated</em>)</h3>
<p><b>PLEASE NOTE</b>: mflyInit is deprecated. We have discovered that, as content libraries become incredibly large, mflyInit consumes an excessive amount of memory. As a result, we strongly suggest using mflyCommands.getFolder() and mflyCommands.getItem() to selectively construct the hierarchy that is needed at that time.</p>
<p>The app calls this function when the app launches an Extension.  The parameter is a dictionary of JSON objects that represent a flattened version of the full hierarchy of folders and items available to the user. The key of each entry is the item/folder slug. Each entry for folders contains a JSON Array called “items”, which contains an array of slugs that are children of this folder.</p>
<p>For example, if a user has the following hierarchy:</p>
<pre><code>  folder [id=slug1]
    item [id=slug2]
    folder [id=slug3]
      item [id=slug4]
</code></pre>
<p>then the object may look like this:</p>
<pre><code>{
  “version”: 2,
  “slug1” : {
    "id": "slug1",
    “items”: [“slug2”, “slug3”],
    "url": "mfly://folder/slug1",
    "type": "folder",
    "name": "Name",
    "description": "Description",
    "date": "2010-11-12T06:15:15:00-06:00",
    "received": "2012-12-19T16:45:14:00-06:00",
    "thumbnailUrl": "mfly://image/123",
    "launched": "false",
    “keywords”: [“keyword1”, “keyword2”, “keyword3”],
    “new”: 1
  },
  “slug2” : {
    "id": "slug2",
    "url": "mfly://item/slug2",
    "type": "video",
    "name": "Name",
    "description": "Description",
    "date": "2010-11-12T06:15:15:00-06:00",
    "received": "2012-12-19T16:45:14:00-06:00",
    "thumbnailUrl": "mfly://image/123",
    "launched": "true",
    “keywords”: [“keyword4”],
    “downloadModel”: “DownloadableShareable”
  },
  “slug3” : {
    "id": "slug3",
    “items”: [“slug4”],
    "url": "mfly://folder/slug3",
    "type": "folder",
    "name": "Name",
    "description": "Description",
    "date": "2010-11-12T06:15:15:00-06:00",
    "received": "2012-12-19T16:45:14:00-06:00",
    "thumbnailUrl": "mfly://image/123",
    "launched": "false"
  },
  “slug4” : {
    "id": "slug4",
    "url": "mfly://item/slug4",
    "type": "interactive",
    "name": "Name",
    "description": "Description",
    "date": "2010-11-12T06:15:15:00-06:00",
    "received": "2012-12-19T16:45:14:00-06:00",
    "thumbnailUrl": "mfly://image/123",
    "launched": "true",
    “new”: 1,
    “downloadModel”: “DownloadableProtected”
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>This function and mflyResume exist in harmony.  mflyInit is called on launch of the Extension. mflyResume is called on both launch and resume of the Extension.</p>
<p>Expect mflyInit to be called many times for large hierarchies, as often as every 2-3 seconds. Consider processing the results of the mflyInit object in parallel. Imagine in the worst case an mflyInit object with 10,000 items, called every 2-3 seconds. If processing that object occurred synchronously, the Extension would grind to a halt or crash with out of memory errors.</p>
<p>Parameter definitions:</p>
<ul>
<li>version: mflyInit uses this version to indicate what the structure of mflyInit looks like. See mflyDataInit for possible versions and what they mean.</li>
<li>items: a list of slugs of the children of this item (if the item is a folder and has any children). This is used to construct the hierarchy</li>
<li>type: can be one of “Audio”, “Video”, “image”, “pdf”, “zip”, “ibooks”, “html”, “youtube”, “keynote”, “png”, “jpeg”, “jpg”, “gif”, “tif”, “tiff”</li>
<li>received: the UTC datetime for when the app received this version of the item.</li>
<li>launched: whether the user has launched this item in the past.</li>
<li>new: for folders, number of items within that folder that are defined as “new” based on client’s business rules. For items, if 1, that item is considered “new”. [iOS 425+]</li>
<li>keywords: any keywords the user set, as a JSON array.</li>
<li>downloadModel: indicates whether the app will allow you to email this item. If downloadModel=DownloadableShareable, this item can be emailed. All other values indicate that the item cannot be emailed. This is visible if mflyDataInit.mflyInitVersion is set to 2.</li>
<li>canShare: indicates whether the app will allow you to email this item. This is available if mflyDataInit.mflyInitVersion &gt;= 3.</li>
<li>canAccessAssetOffline: indicates whether the item is allowed to be downloaded and stored encrypted, per business rules. Applies to video, documents, audio and images. This is available if mflyDataInit.mflyInitVersion &gt;= 3.</li>
<li>canDownloadAsset: indicates whether the app is allowed to download the item and open it in an external application, unencrypted. Applies to e.g. iBooks, KeyNote, Excel. This is available if mflyDataInit.mflyInitVersion &gt;= 3.</li>
</ul>
